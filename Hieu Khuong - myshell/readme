I/O REDIRECTION
        
		Output of one command can be chained to the input of another command. The syntax is as follow:
            $ command1 | command2
        where command1 sends data through pipe to command2.

        
		Output of commands can be redirected from stdout to a file with a symbol:
            $ command > outputfile
        In this case, the output of command is redirected to outfile, if file does not exist then the shell will create one.

        
		Input of commands can be from a file:
            $ command < infile
        The command takes input from infile.

BACKGROUND PROCESS
        
        To run a program in background, add '&' after the command name, such as:
            $ [command]&
        The process runs silently in background and the user can use the shell.
